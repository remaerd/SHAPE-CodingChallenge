# Chicken Talk To Ducks / Coding Challenge </br> 雞同鴨講 / 代碼挑戰

[!](globe.png)
Welcome to Hong Kong! In this coding Challenge, let's try to challenge ourselves to create a 3D Globe

[Globe.JS Demo - US International Outbound](https://globe.gl/example/airline-routes/us-international-outbound.html)

## Adding New Data

Since we are recording audio/video/image while you are traveling around H.K. I created a Google Form for us to submit our Cultural Hybridisation Findings. In this form, after you submit the form. Your data will be recorded in a shared Google Form.

[Google Sheet (View Only)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q61zFO1cakAhbah1PfQ8KMVRqp6aivJLSRWwZpk6fe0/edit?usp=sharing)

## Creating a dynamic Globe

In this coding challenge, we will try to use [Globe.GL](https://globe.gl) to create an interactive 3D Globe. Since I had shared the Google Form to the general public. You can easily access the latest data from the following CSV file online.

`https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQfSw3lFV-lNn3Lo3Qav1LbGN24x8FSKKL5xDh2fjLiPQNUhUVfYQU0IGyhbZWs4u0QYmVog0k5ayPo/pub?output=csv`

Since [Globe.GL](https://globe.gl) already provided some really powerful APIs for us, How do we utilise the data we collected to create a data visualisation art piece to demonstrate the connections behind these Cultural Hybridisation Phenomenons? Now it's your time to implement your own design!

## Publish your design

Since you have made many efforts to create this website, please do share it with us in our WhatsApp Group! If you have successfully created an interesting artifact, you will receive a secret gift from me!

Good Luck!
